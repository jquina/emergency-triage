83,"Inappropriate history","When the history (story) given does not explain the physical findings it is termed inappropriate. This is important as it is a marker of non-accidental injury in vulnerable children and adults and may be the sentinel for abuse"
84,"Inconsolable by parents","Children whose crying or distress does not respond to attempts by their parents to comfort them fulfil this criterion"
85,"Increased work of breathing","Increased work of breathing is shown as increased respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles and grunting"

140,"Responds to pain","Response to a painful stimulus. Standard periph­eral stimuli should be used - a pencil or pen is used to apply pressure to the finger nail bed. This stimulus should not be applied to the toes since a spinal reflex may cause flexion even in brain death. Supraorbital ridge pressure should not be used since reflex grimacing may occur"
141,"Responds to voice","Response to a vocal stimulus. It is not necessary to shout the patients' name. Children may fail to respond because they are afraid"
142,"Retention of urine","Inability to pass urine per urethra associated with an enlarged bladder. This condition is usually very painful unless there is altered sensation"
